Uses several machine learning models to predict the outcome of the tournament that never was.

# Introduction
Sadly, the 2020 NCAA Menâ€™s Basketball tournament could not be held this year due to the coronavirus. I found data on the past four years of college basketball seasons and thought it would be interesting to see if I could accurately represent what could have been. Based on several variables in this dataset found in Appendix 1 and 2.1, is it possible to predict the teams that will make the tournament using machine learning techniques? Also, based on this information, can we give an estimate of the round this team will make it to? These are great questions to be answered using a variety of different predictive models.
